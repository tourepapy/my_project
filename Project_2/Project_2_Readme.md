# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

## Problem Statement:
Develop a regression model to predict the sale prices of houses in Ames, Iowa, using the provided dataset. The dataset includes various features of houses, such as their size, condition, age, neighborhood, and other attributes. The model's objective is to accurately predict the sale price based on these features, assisting potential buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in making informed decisions about property values in Ames. The model's performance will be evaluated based on its accuracy and ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

## Background
The Ames Housing Dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock, serves as an educational alternative to the Boston Housing dataset, offering a more complex challenge for predictive modeling. It details the sale of residential properties in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010, featuring an extensive set of 79 variables. These variables cover a broad range of aspects, both qualitative and quantitative, such as house size, age, room number, material quality, neighborhood, and other conditions and locations aspects. The primary goal with this dataset is to predict the final sale price of homes, making it highly suitable for regression analysis. Its complexity and richness in features make it a popular choice in educational settings for teaching advanced regression techniques, feature engineering, and data cleaning. Additionally, its real-world applicability makes it a valuable tool for data science professionals to develop and refine predictive modeling skills.

## Data Description

The Ames Housing Dataset is a comprehensive collection of data on residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa, between 2006 and 2010.

1. **General Information**: The dataset includes a variety of information about each property, such as zoning classification, lot frontage, lot area, street and alley access types, and the general shape and contour of the land. It also provides details about utilities available, lot configuration, and the slope of the property.

2. **Neighborhood and Proximity**: It contains information about the neighborhood where each property is located and its proximity to various conditions like arterial streets, railroads, parks, etc.

3. **Physical Property Attributes**: The dataset covers detailed attributes of the properties, including the type of dwelling, style of the house, quality and condition ratings, year of construction, and information about any remodeling. It also includes specifics about the roof style and material, types of exterior coverings, masonry veneer type, quality of exterior materials, and the foundation type.

4. **Interior and Basement Features**: It provides extensive details about the interior of the houses, such as the height and condition of basements, types of heating and air conditioning systems, electrical system types, and the quality of kitchens. The dataset also includes information about the number and quality of fireplaces.

5. **Garage and Parking Spaces**: Details about the garage, including its type, finish, year of construction, and capacity, are included.

6. **Outdoor Features and Other Amenities**: Information about outdoor features like pool area and the value of miscellaneous features are also part of the dataset.

7. **Sale Information**: The most crucial aspect for predictive modeling – the sale price of the property – is included as the target variable. This data is accompanied by details about the month and year of sale, the type and condition of the sale.

8. **Feature Engineering Opportunities**: The dataset allows for extensive feature engineering, such as combining or transforming existing features to better capture the essence of the data. For instance, basement features, porch attributes, and the overall condition of the house can be restructured for more effective analysis.

9. **Handling Missing and Erroneous Data**: The dataset contains some missing values and occasionally misspelled or incorrectly recorded data, which requires careful preprocessing and cleaning.

10. **Modeling and Analysis**: Various models, including linear regression and tree-based models, have been used to analyze this dataset, focusing on key features that significantly impact house prices, such as the overall quality, size, remodeling year, and neighborhood type.
